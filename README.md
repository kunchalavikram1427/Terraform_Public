# Terraform Made Easy
Terraform is HashiCorpâ€™s Infrastructure as Code tool. 
It lets you define infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle. 
All configuration files  are written in HCL(HashiCorp Configuration Language).
Most of the IaC tools, like Chef and Ansible, follow the client-server architecture while Terraform uses cloud provider APIs to configure the infrastructure.
Cloud-agnostic nature; you can deploy infrastructure to any cloud environment, such as Azure, AWS, GCP, and VMware, as well as on-premises environments.
